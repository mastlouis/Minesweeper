Minesweeper
============

This is a game of Minesweeper that I am making primarily to become more familiar with JavaScript.

Usage
-----
To launch the app, open the <a>mines.html</a> file in any browser. The browser used for testing was Safari.  
Make sure that all files (default.css, gameFunction.js) are present in the same folder.

Rules
-----
Left click a tile to trip it. Right click a tile to flag it.  
The goal is to flag all 16 mines and to trip every other square.  

Each square will either be a mine or a number (or blank).  
If a square has a number, the number indicates the number of tiles adjacent to that square that are mines.  
Blank squares are not adjacent to any mines.
